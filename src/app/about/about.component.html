<p>My coding history began in High School, where I took classes in C++. While that language wasn't for me, it did teach me fundamentals such as functions and if/else statements.</p><p>

    Upon graduating High School, I thought coding as a whole was a poor fit so I studied art instead. Wanting to study 3D, to make interactive DVD menus, I went to a college that dropped those courses right as I started. I did leave with graphic and multimedia design experience though. A year after graduating, I went to a different school, this time to learn 3D. I also worked a little in Flash, using some of my C++ knowledge to create ActionScript.</p><p>
    
    A few years in the workforce ended when I got laid off. This provided the opportunity to switch gears in my career. I used the time to teach myself jQuery as well as enhance my HTML and CSS abilities. I found the modern interactivity of web pages to be even more than that of the DVD menus I once sought to create.</p>
