    <p>My coding history began in High School, where I took classes in C++. While that language wasn't for me, it did teach me fundamentals such as functions and if/else statements.</p>
    <p>Upon graduating High School, I thought coding as a whole was a poor fit so I studied art instead. Wanting to study 3D, to make interactive DVD menus, I went to a college that dropped those courses right as I started. I did leave with graphic and multimedia design experience though. A year after graduating, I went to a different school, this time to learn 3D. I also worked a little in Flash, using some of my C++ knowledge to create ActionScript.</p>
    <p>A few years in the workforce ended when I got laid off. This provided the opportunity to switch gears in my career. I used the time to teach myself jQuery as well as enhance my HTML and CSS abilities. I found the modern interactivity of web pages to be even more than that of the DVD menus I once sought to create.</p>
    <p>Working at ClearChannel (now known as iHeartRadio), I was able to blend web products with those in person. Promoting live events, and sometimes having web experiences at said events, brought the digital and real world together.</p>
    <p>Uncommon Goods provided the opportunity of a constant evolution of a product. Sometimes building new solutions, other times refactoring solutions to be more scalable and efficient.</p>
